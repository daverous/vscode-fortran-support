## Requirements
For the linter to work you need to have `gfortran` on your path, or wherever you configure it to be.
## Issues
Please report any issues and feature request on the github repo [here](https://github.com/krvajalmiguelangel/vscode-fortran-support/issues/new)
## Notice
The syntax highlight support was imported from [TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/fortran.tmbundle)

The idea of using gfortran cames from this awesome [fortran plugin](https://github.com/315234/SublimeFortran) for Sublime Text.

This is a fork of the repo https://github.com/krvajalmiguelangel/vscode-fortran-support, but with better syntax highlighting and ifort support rather than VS code.
